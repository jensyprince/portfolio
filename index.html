        <p>I am Junior Web Developer going through the Road to Hire apprenticeship. In the road to hire apprenticeship I
            have learned multiple languages and technologies such as <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a>,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">Javascript</a>, <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library)">React</a>, <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL">mySQL</a>, and <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js">Node</a>. It wasnt always an easy learning process there
            were many times I would get stuck when doing assignments or projects and thats where I learned to ask more
            questions especially to my mentors and peers.During the program not only did I learn the technical side of
            things I also learned how to me more proffessional in the work environment by working on my public speaking
            skills and working on communicating with my peers or managers. I realised my passion for coding in august of
            2020 when I was tasked with creating a website i would like people to travel to. I had a lot of fun being
            able to have such creative freedom and being able to showcase what I could do by myself. Designing and
            working on web developement are not my only passions I also love to play sports mainly soccer and basketball
            with friends and I'm also a big foodie so whenever I get the chance I will be out enjoying new foods. </p>
